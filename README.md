Once a developer signs up, he/she will be able to view all the posts of other developers, be able to like/unlike posts and even comment on posts. He/she can also post their own content and questions which can be responded by other developers. This provides a platform for upcoming or existing developers to discuss the issues they are facing in their code or about other new technologies.
